1,Tomato : Early Blight,"Early blight is one of the most common tomato diseases, occurring nearly every season wherever tomatoes are grown.
It affects leaves, fruits and stems and can be severely yield limiting when susceptible cultivars are used and weather is favorable.
Severe defoliation can occur and result in sunscald on the fruit.
Early blight is common in both field and high tunnel tomato production in Minnesota.","Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.
Make sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.
Keep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.
Drip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.
For best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.
Containing copper and pyrethrins, Bonide® Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as needed.",https://extension.umn.edu/sites/extension.umn.edu/files/styles/large/public/early-blight-leaf-tomato.jpg?itok=woYQQlrF
1,Tomato : Healthy,"Fertilize one week before as well as on the day of planting. They especially love phosphorous, which promotes the formation of blossoms and the fruits or vegetables that grow from them. Avoid high nitrogen when your tomato plants have blossoms as it promotes vine growth rather than fruit growth.Don't Crowd Tomato Seedlings.Provide Lots of Light.Preheat the Garden Soil.Bury the Stems.Mulch Tomatoes After the Soil Has Warmed.Remove the Bottom Leaves.Pinch and Prune for More Tomatoes.Water Regularly.","The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a fruit from the nightshade family native to South America.

Despite botanically being a fruit, it’s generally eaten and prepared like a vegetable.

Tomatoes are the major dietary source of the antioxidant lycopene, which has been linked to many health benefits, including reduced risk of heart disease and cancer.

They are also a great source of vitamin C, potassium, folate, and vitamin K.",https://cdn8.dissolve.com/p/D869_27_632/D869_27_632_1200.jpg
2,Tomato : Late Blight,"Late blight is caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. Oomycetes are fungus-like organisms also called water molds, but they are not true fungi.
There are many different strains of P. infestans. These are called clonal lineages and designated by a number code (i.e. US-23). Many clonal lineages affect both tomato and potato, but some lineages are specific to one host or the other.Late blight is a potentially devastating disease of tomato and potato, infecting leaves, stems and fruits of tomato plants.
The disease spreads quickly in fields and can result in total crop failure if untreated.
Late blight of potato was responsible for the Irish potato famine of the late 1840s.","Sanitation is the first step in controlling tomato late blight. Clean up all debris and fallen fruit from the garden area. This is particularly essential in warmer areas where extended freezing is unlikely and the late blight tomato disease may overwinter in the fallen fruit. Currently, there are no strains of tomato available that are resistant to late tomato blight, so plants should be inspected at least twice a week. Since late blight symptoms are more likely to occur during wet conditions, more care should be taken during those times. For the home gardener, fungicides that contain maneb, mancozeb, chlorothanolil or fixed copper can help protect plants from late tomato blight. Repeated applications are necessary throughout the growing season as the disease can strike at any time. For organic gardeners, there are some fixed copper products approved for use; otherwise, all infected plants must be immediately removed and destroyed.","https://www.canr.msu.edu/contentAsset/image/e97d1ef0-5b55-49b0-ab4e-c57dcbeca65e/fileAsset/filter/Resize,Jpeg/resize_w/750/jpeg_q/80"
3,Tomato : Leaf Miner,,,
4,Tomato : Magnesium Deficiency,,,
5,Tomato : Nitrogen Deficiency,"Nitrogen deficiency is one of the most common nutrient-related problems faced by tomato plants. Nitrogen is a vital nutrient that plays a key role in the plant's growth and development. It is essential for the production of chlorophyll, the green pigment in leaves responsible for photosynthesis—the process by which plants make food. When nitrogen is lacking, the plant cannot produce enough energy, resulting in slow growth and poor health.","To prevent nitrogen deficiency in tomato plants, use a balanced fertilizer that includes nitrogen from the early growth stage. Regularly add organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure to enrich the soil naturally. Rotate crops each season to avoid nutrient depletion in the same soil. Also, monitor leaf color often—healthy green leaves indicate good nitrogen levels.",
